### Comment

* Kobe:     
    I am really interested in the compiling process and I consider this module really important for CS students. However, the desciption mentioned that [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is used as the medium of instruction. Though the course is language agnostic, Haskell might involves in the coursework developing.
