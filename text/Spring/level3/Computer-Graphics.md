### Convenor:
* [Dr Jeremie Clos](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszjc1/)

### Aim:
* To show the mathematical basis of 3D computer graphics through modelling and transformation of 3D objects, viewing 3D object in diff ways, and protecting 3D objects onto the 2D computer screen
* To provide pratical means for learning and understanding the 3D computer graphics pipeline, methods and programming skill for modeling, transforming, viewing and projecting 3D objects, and adding realism to them.

### Content:
* You will learn the principles of three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics, focusing on modeling, animating, and viewing ojects / scenes in a victual world on the computer, projecting objects / rendering the objects / scenes to give them realism
* Through weekly lectures, tutorials and laboratory sessions you will explore various computer graphics techniques and you will develop your OpenGL programming skills for 3D computer graphics application
* The course demonstrates the benefits of the linking theory and pratice

### Assessment:
* CW --------- 100% (in three parts)
