### Convenor:
* [Dr Andrew Parkes](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/people/Andrew.Parkes)

### Content:
* Theoretical limits on computing & complexity theory
    * Gives a classification hierachy of problems in CS
    * The CS equivalent of the periodic table in chemistry, or the range of algorithms encountered in CS
    * "It is hard to be effective at a new problems if you cannot tell what kind of 'beast' you are dealing with and so be able to look at how other problems in the same class were treated".
* Carefully examine the complexity classes "P" and "NP"
    * Includes practial relevance in optimisation (including machine laerning)
* Other practically important classes such as "PSPACE". Relevance to
    * Adversarial games - "why are chess/Go/etc.harder than scheduling/TSP/etc"
* Complexity classes relevant to parallel computation (such as "NC")
    * "Is there a highly effective way to use multiple cores?", or when is a problem such that is not possible to "fully exploit multiple cores" ? (Useful if studying algorithms to try to exploit cores/cloud computing)
